## 🧭 Game Overview

**Genre:** 

Top-Down Action Roguelite / Procedural Combat / Slot-Machine World

**What is this game?**  

A top-down roguelite set inside a broken slot machine. Each “spin” reshapes the world — enemies, environments, and loot all emerge from the reels’ outcomes. The player fights through randomized combat arenas generated by combinations of slot symbols, trying to survive and reach the machine’s core.

Between runs, players modify the slot itself — unlocking or altering reels, symbols, and modifiers. The gamble isn’t just aesthetic; it defines the game’s logic, economy, and progression.

## ⚙️ Core Mechanics

- Movement: Keyboard-based top-down controls; fast and responsive.
- Combat: Real-time shooting or melee; quick, skill-based encounters.
- Abilities: Earn and spend points mid-run for temporary power-ups (reset each run).
- Upgrades:
- - In-run: Randomized loot or slot-based rolls.
- - Base: Permanent upgrades using extracted materials.
- Gambling: Optional slot system to risk resources for higher-tier rewards.

## 🔁 Core Game Loop
1. **Spin the Slot** – Player starts a run; slot results decide the world’s layout, modifiers, and loot odds.  
2. **Enter the World** – Fight, loot, and survive in the generated area.  
3. **Extract or Die** – Win to earn a slot payout; failure still yields minimal progression.  
4. **Upgrade the Slot** – Spend winnings to unlock new reels, symbols, or bias modifiers.  
5. **Repeat** – Spin again, dive back in, risk more for bigger rewards.

## 🎯 Goals & Motivation
- **Player Goals:** Progress through increasingly difficult worlds, gather loot, and upgrade the slot machine base.  
- **Progression Loop:** Loot collected in runs is used to enhance reels, symbols, and modifiers back at the slot base.  
- **Motivation:** Each upgrade makes future spins more controllable or profitable, encouraging riskier and deeper runs.  
- **Win / Loss:** Still open — could be defined later (e.g., endless progression, final machine core, or narrative endpoint).
