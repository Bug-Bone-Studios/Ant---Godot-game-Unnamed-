## 🔁 Core Game Loop
# 🎰 Game Concept Overview

## Core Idea
A **dual-layer game** combining a **Tycoon Management Sim** and a **Roguelike** — both feeding into each other through interconnected currencies and upgrades.

---

## 🏢 Layer 1: Casino Tycoon (Main World)
- Manage and upgrade a casino to generate *Clean Money* (💵).
- Build rooms, hire staff, and improve décor to boost passive income.
- One special machine — the **Corrupted Slot** — is playable and central to progression.

### Key Features
- Upgradable lobby generates passive income.
- Office area acts as the player’s management hub.
- Use Clean Money to expand the casino and unlock more systems.
- Balance upgrades vs. corruption creeping into your business.

---

## 🌀 Layer 2: The Corrupted Slot (Roguelike Game)
- A **roguelike adventure** that takes place *inside* the corrupted slot machine.
- Each run gives the player **Corrupted Tokens** (🧿).
- Tokens are used to buy corruption modifiers or upgrades for the slot and main world.

### Key Features
- Procedural levels and combat (or another roguelike mechanic).
- No inventory; instead, players plug in “corruptions” bought in the casino.
- Corruptions grant run modifiers (e.g., start with a sword, new abilities, higher difficulty, better rewards).

---

## 🔄 Gameplay Loop

1. **Earn Clean Money**
   - The casino generates passive income over time.
   - Upgrades and expansions increase earnings.

2. **Enter the Corrupted Slot**
   - The player “plays” the slot (roguelike segment).
   - Completing stages rewards *Corrupted Tokens.*

3. **Fuse the Two Currencies**
   - Spend 💵 + 🧿 together for powerful meta upgrades:
     - *Slot Instability:* Adds harder roguelike modifiers with better rewards.
     - *Corrupted Influence:* Boosts passive income, but may cause negative events.
     - *New Game Slots:* Unlocks new roguelike zones.

4. **Meta Progression**
   - As corruption spreads, both worlds evolve.
   - Visual and mechanical corruption alters the casino’s appearance and economy.
   - The player must balance profit vs. corruption.

## 🎭 Thematic

## 🎯 Goals & Motivation
- **Player Goals:** Progress through increasingly difficult worlds, gather loot, and upgrade the slot machine base.  
- **Progression Loop:** Loot collected in runs is used to enhance reels, symbols, and modifiers back at the slot base.  
- **Motivation:** Each upgrade makes future spins more controllable or profitable, encouraging riskier and deeper runs.  
- **Win / Loss:** Still open — could be defined later (e.g., endless progression, final machine core, or narrative endpoint).
